			<h2>Opinion: If Flash is dead, is HTML5 now ready for the big time?</h2>
			<p>There was a 17 year gap between HTML5, which was finalised and published on October 28 2014, and its predecessor HTML4. In that time, the technology landscape changed in virtually every conceivable way. Google was founded a year after HTML4 was finalised. Mark Zuckerberg was 13 years old. Steve Jobs had only just returned to Apple. Heck, in the UK, it would be a year until it was possible to send an SMS to someone on a different mobile network.</p>
			<p>Even though HTML5 has been in development since 2004, it wasn’t until April 2010 when a famous open letter by Steve Jobs called ‘Thoughts on Flash’ pushed it into the public sphere. Over the intervening years, there has been a lot of talk amongst developers and the media about whether HTML5 could replace native apps.</p>
			<p>HTML5 has gone from strength to strength, winning major support from YouTube, who announced that HTML5 is now the default for its videos; Facebook, who announced it was shifting from Flash to HTML5; Google, who stopped supporting Flash entirely in its Chrome browser earlier this year; Amazon, who recently banned Flash advertising content on its site; even Adobe, who changed the name of its Adobe Flash Professional CC, now called Adobe Animate, specifically targeted at HTML5 development.</p>
			<p>Flash, therefore, is all but dead. Yet is HTML5 ready to take its place?</p>
			<p>If we were to look at this as the question alone, then yes, every use for Flash is being replaced by HTML5. HTML5 is the future of the web and the language which anyone developing web portals or sites should be using. As a language used to create responsive websites, HTML5 is most certainly what developers should be using.</p>
