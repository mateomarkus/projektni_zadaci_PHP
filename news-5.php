			<h2>Opinion: Should you choose a Web or a Native app?</h2>
			<p>The first step in developing an app is determining whether it should be native or on the web. This decision will impact every stage of development, from hiring the right programmers to determining which devices it can be accessed on.</p>
			<p>While current technology allows for hybrid applications — either by wrapping browser scripting in a native app like Adobe PhoneGap or by compiling C# or Java into native code like Xamarin — the process can be slow, especially on cheaper phones that don’t have a lot of memory or processing power.</p>
			<p>Regardless of which hybrid development strategy you choose, only a portion of your application will actually be hybrid. There will still be some native development for every platform you wish to utilize.</p>
			<p>There are also strict limitations on design capabilities depending on the hybrid solution you choose, as developers must use predefined design elements to fit the current hybrid methods. Hybrid platforms may exist, but the work, time, and other resources necessary to deploy one are extreme — equivalent to building a native app on each operating system.</p>
			<p>Choosing between a web, native, or hybrid app largely depends on the needs of your project. Cost and reliability are factors, though they’re not the only ones. Here are three questions to ask when determining your needs.</p>
